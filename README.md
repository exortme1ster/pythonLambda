## Overview

This project describes behaviour of Lambda Function.<br/>
The Lambda function checks in a binary search algorithm whether the logs in the given time range are present or not.<br/>

If the logs are present, the response returned is the md5 hash of logs with a statusCode of 200.<br/>
If no logs were present in the timerange, the response is a 400-level message with a message that logs were not present in the time range.
